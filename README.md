# Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Kaggle
Hello Everyone, although I'm not very good at this but since free colab notebooks are not properly working anymore I tried to make a notebook for Kaggle.

Those who are new to Kaggle i would try my best to explain things in easy way

**But before we start I would like inform you that kaggle is not Google Colab so nsfw content is prohibited on Kaggle plateform**
**But don't you worry I'm here (‚Å†ÔΩ°‚Å†‚Ä¢ÃÄ‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†-‚Å†)‚Å†‚úß**

`lite` has a stable WebUI and stable installed extensions. <br />
`stable` has ControlNet v1.1, a stable WebUI, and stable installed extensions. <br />
`nightly` has ControlNet v1.1 the latest WebUI with PyTorch 2.0, and daily installed extension updates. <br />
