# How to create a Kaggle account ? <br>
1. Go to the Kaggle website and click on sign up section. <br>
2. Setup your Kaggle profile by providing a brief bio, picture, location, title and current workplace. You can also add your LinkedIn, Github and Facebook accounts so people can contact you when needed. <br>

# Now comes the most crucial part <br>
**Account Verification** <br>
Without this you won't be able to use ***Kaggle GPU*** even after you sign up into Kaggle, so better verify <br>

**Follow These steps to verify your Kaggle account.** <br>
1. Go to your account profile and click on your Account; this will lead to a page that contains your account information.
2. Click “Edit Public Profile”.
3. Scroll down to “Phone Verification”, and click on the hyperlink: “Not Verified”.
4. "Once the phone number is sorted, check the CAPTCHA box to click the final button “Send verification code”
5. At this point, if you get a verification code, you can go ahead and finish up the verification process. However, if you get a message like this one below that states “This phone number cannot be verified”, or any other similar statement then click “Contact us for help” in the black panel on the right.
* If you encounter a statement like “This phone number has been used many times. Please try a different number”, it is because several attempts have been made to verify that particular number OR “You have exceeded the quota for this request. Please wait a bit and try again later”, it is because you have attempted the verification too many times in a short while, and you need to try at a later time. The important thing to note is that the same phone number verification issue elicited these responses, and trying out the steps in this infographic is sure to resolve it).
* A page full of possible issues you might encounter on Kaggle will pop up. We’ve found you receive a quicker response from Kaggle support if you select, “I found an issue with the website” under the category “other”. Clicking that will launch a sort of form for your complaint.
* Click on "I found an issue with verification".
* Fill out the required fields, check the CAPTCHA box, and click “Contact Support”
* All you can do right now is wait, and your request will typically get sorted in 24 hours.
* You most likely will receive a mail stating that you can now get your account verified. Log back into Kaggle to repeat steps 3 to 5.
* You should get a response soon enough. <br>
